# About
- I designed Scrollfolio to be a premium experience. Every element, from the layout to the scroll effects, was engineered to hook the user and clearly communicate my high standards for both technical execution and creative polish.

## Technologies Used
- Javascript(GSAP)
- HTML
- CSS
 ---
## Features
- Clear Work Showcase : The project site is tight and efficient, showing three projects side-by-side. This keeps the portfolio organized and ensures you can see my range of work immediately.
- Advanced style & layout : The site’s entire look is built with clean CSS Grid and Flexbox, making sure the high-contrast design is perfectly organized and visually striking.
- Clean Workflow: The porfolio layout including contact system is streamlined: hitting the "Say Hi!" button takes you to a dedicated, fixed-screen contact page, keeping the experience fast and distraction-free.
